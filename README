1. Brief Overview:
This program is designed to determine whether the letter above a given torpedo hole is a W or an N. It uses opencv's SIFT algorithm to calculate descriptors of the target image as well as test images (e.g. an isolated W or N). 
It then compares the descriptors of the target image's letter to the descriptors of the test letters, and finds a match using a KNN approach- the top k candidates are looked at, and whichever (W or N) has more matches is determined to be the letter of the target.

2. How to run the program.
a) Load in an array, named test_corners, from the test_corners.txt file supplied (just copy-paste). (Test image test.jpg corresponds to the first array, test2.jpg to the second)
b) Load in your test image (test.jpg) with cv2.imread("full/file/path")
c) Send the rectangle corners and the image you loaded in to the function mapCharsToRects.
d) Sit back and watch the magic happen! Results are displayed in the same order inputted (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
